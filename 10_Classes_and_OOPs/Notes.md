# Js and OOPs

## Does Js have Classes?

--> Actually, NO It does not.
Yes, JavaScript does have classes. This feature was introduced with the ES6. However, it's important to note that JavaScript is primarily a <b>prototype-based language</b>, and its classes are primarily syntactic sugar over existing prototype-based inheritance mechanisms.

## OOPS
A programming paradigm/style

## Objects
- collection of properties and methods
- toLowerCase

## Parts of OOPs

1. Object literal --> literally Object
2. Constructor function
3. Prototypes
4. Classes
5. Instances (new, this)

## 4 pillars
- Abstraction  --> Implementation Hiding |  Displays only the essential features of the object and hides implementation.
- Encapsulation --> Data Hiding |  Restricts direct access to an objectâ€™s data
- Inheritance -->  Inherit Properties | Class can derive properties and characteristics from another class, allowing code reuse
- Polymorphism --> Mulitple Forms | Allows a single entity (like a function or an object) to be used in many forms, depending on the context.
